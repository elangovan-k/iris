Just a starter code from the famous machine learning book.\
	1) Used K-nearest-neighbors classifier with neighbor=1 as the model to predict the class of the flower with the given deimensions. \
	2) Used the pandas plotting technique to visualize the correlation between each of the features for the 3 classes. \
	3) The visualization helped us to know that the 3 classes are clustered or grouped into 3 varying classes. \
	4) After the model has been trained, the hypothesis is tested using the test set and the accuracy resulted in 1. \
	5) Atlast, the final model is deployed for predicting the flower classes from the feature inputs by the user.
